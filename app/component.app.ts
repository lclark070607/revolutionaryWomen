    "bio":"Berta Caceras was a Honduran environmental activist, indigenous leader of her people, and co-founder and coordinator of the Council of Popular and Indigenous Organizations of Honduras (COPINH). She won the Goldman Environmental Prize in 2015, for a grassroots campaign that successfully pressured the world’s largest dam builder to pull out of the Agua Zarca Dam at the Río Gualcarque. She was assassinated in her home by armed intruders, after years of threats against her life. A former soldier with the US-trained special forces units of the Honduran military asserted that Caceres name was included on a hitlist distributed to them months before her assassination. According to a February 2017 investigation by The Guardian, court papers show that three of the eight people arrested in connection with the assassination are linked to the US-trained elite troops. Two of them, Maj Mariano Díaz and Lt Douglas Giovanny Bustillo, received military training in the US, in Fort Benning, Georgia, site of the former School of the Americas (SOA), now WHINSEC; the SOA has been linked to thousands of murders and human right violations by its graduates in Latin America (via Wikipedia)."
